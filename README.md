# Automated-Railway-Gate-Control
This system is designed to manage the control system of railway gate using the 8051 microcontroller. The main purpose of this project is to propose an idea to make the process automated so that the probability of accidents at railroad crossings reduces drastically. As a train approaches the railway crossing from either side, the sensors placed at a certain distance from the gate detects the approaching train and informs the microcontroller about it. This signal is used to trigger the microcontroller for opening or closing of gates. The abstraction of this system is to provide the advanced control system available everywhere.
